# editorWidth.css
[Source](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/adjustable-readable-line-length/7564/7), though had to tweak CSS selectors to make it work in my vaults.

Located at `.obsidian/snippets/editorWidth.css`.

No more huge gaps on both sides of your notes in edit and view modes.
You can tweak the % amount in the file to fine-tune how much gap you want at the sides.
